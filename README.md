# GWI-solution
This repository contains my solution (4st place, solo gold medal) for the Kaggle competition of [Yale/UNC-CH - Geophysical Waveform Inversion](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/waveform-inversion). See also my summary [on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/waveform-inversion/discussion/587500).  
# The steps to reproduce my solution  
## 1. Generating more data
[This notebook demonstrate creating CurveFaultB](https://www.kaggle.com/code/shlomoron/gwi-generate-cfb-public/notebook). I had similar ones to create CurveVel and StyleA/B.
